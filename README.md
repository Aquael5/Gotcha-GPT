Gotcha GPT ensures the integrity of academic writing in universities and publishing houses due to advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It discriminates AI- and human-generated english manuscripts.

Gotcha GPT is a code to dicriminate AI- and human-generated english manuscripts by using classifier models (Decision trees, Extra Trees, Random Forest, and AdaBoost).

The Gotcha GPT framework is highly versatile (coded in Google Colab). It uses Scikit learn libraries to provide the statisctics (precision, accuracy, recall, F1, MCC, and Cohen´ Kappa scores) and the confusion matrix to guarantee confidence to the user. There is a text dataset of about 400 AI-generated texts and around 400 human-generated texts used for training and testing (50/50 random split).

# Installation instructions

Gotcha GPT is 100% compatible with Google Colab platform developed in Microsoft Windows using Python version 3.10.

# Documentation

The complete documentation about how to run the Gotcha GPT protocol and several tutorials is being developed.

# Get help

Gotcha GPT is being actively developed and some issues may arise or you may need extra help to run Gotcha GPT. In those cases, there are two main ways to get help:

1) Open a new issue in this repository
Or 
2) write an email to André Silva Pimentel (a_pimentel@puc-rio.br) (I will do my best to answer your questions as soon as possible).
